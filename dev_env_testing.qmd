## Introduction 

The purpose of this repo is to help with testing of development environments e.g. using Python for data analysis.  

We'll first test the components individually, before testing how the components integrate within an IDE.  

## PATH

The PATH environment variable specifies the set of directories used to search for executable (.exe) files.

**Resource:**  
[path command (MS Learn)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/path)
:::  

It's worth noting the PATH of the vanilla AVD prior to ADMIN installation of Python, Git, etc. 

Note the PATH again before any end user configuration or installation.

> To get the PATH, open a terminal, type `echo %PATH%`, and press enter.

PATH is a combination of system and user PATH environment variables. We can see and edit the **user** (not system) PATH via *Edit environment variables for your account*:

## Python installation

> To test whether Python is installed, open a terminal, type `python --version`, and press enter.

> To find where Python is installed, open a terminal, type `where python`, and press enter.

## Multiple Python versions  

*TODO: not a priority for the Windows 11 deadline.*

## Python Launcher

On Windows, the `py` command can be used in place of `python`. 

When there are multiple versions of Python installed, using the `python` command is more ambiguous on Windows than other operating systems. Typing `python` may run whichever version was added to PATH last â€” which can get confusing.  

::: {.column-margin}
**Resource:**  
[Python Launcher for Windows (Python documentation)](https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#python-launcher-for-windows)
:::  

The `py` command uses the Python Launcher for Windows, which is a utility that helps locate and execute different Python versions. 

> To see where the Python Launcher is installed, open a terminal, type `where py`, and press enter.

## Python package installation  

> To test whether [pip](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/key_projects/#pip) is available, open a terminal, type `py -m pip --version`, and press enter.

> To test whether we can install a Python package (e.g. pandas), open a terminal, type `py -m pip install pandas`, and press enter.

## Python package location  

Python packages can be stored at three different levels:

**Resource:**  
[How to find python library path (edureka)](https://www.edureka.co/community/101278/how-do-find-the-location-of-my-python-site-packages-directory)
:::

1. global  
1. user  
1. project  

Project level is known as a "virtual environment" and is best practice. It is covered under the venv heading below.

> To see where Python packages are installed at the **global** level, open a terminal, type `py -c "import site; print(site.getsitepackages())"`, and press enter.  

![](resources/packages-global.png){width=550}  

> To see where Python packages are installed at the **user** level, open a terminal, type `py -m site --user-site`, and press enter.  

![](resources/packages-user.png){width=500}  

When we installed the pandas Python package in the preceding section, the resulting message included "Defaulting to user installation becaise normal site-package is not writeable".   

> To see where the pandas Python package is installed, open a terminal, type `pip show pandas`, and press enter.

## Quarto  

Quarto is included in the Positron install.  

> To test the Quarto installation, open a terminal, type `quarto check`, and press enter.

## Git

> To test whether Git is installed, open a terminal, type `git --version`, and press enter.

## Positron workflow

### Clone repo

> Copy the HTTPS web URL for the [github.com/scc-pi/test-dev-env](https://github.com/scc-pi/test-dev-env) repo.

::: {.column-margin}
**Testing:**    

1. Positron  
1. Git
:::

![](resources/repo-web-url.jpg)  

https://github.com/scc-pi/test-dev-env.git

> Open Positron.

> Create a new folder from Git (*File* > *New Folder from Git...*):

![](resources/new-folder-git.jpg)  

> Paste the web URL for the repo:  

![](resources/paste-repo-url.jpg)  

> In the Explorer pane you should see a few files from the repo:  

![](resources/explorer-few-files.jpg)

### Create virtual environment

> To create a new virtual environment, from the Command Palette (*Ctrl* + *Shift* + *P*) start typing "Python: Create Environment" and select *Python: Create Environment...*: 

::: {.column-margin}
**Testing:**    

1. Positron  
1. Python  
1. Venv  
1. Python package installation
:::

![](resources/cmd-palette-create-env.jpg)  

> Select *venv* as the environment type:  

![](resources/venv-select.jpg)  

> Select a Python interpreter:  

![](resources/python-interpreter-select.jpg)  

> Select the dependencies (Python packages) to install by checking `requirements.txt` file tick box:  

![](resources/requirements-select.jpg)

> Wait while the environment is created:  

![](resources/creating-env.jpg)

> Once it's done you should get a notification and you should also see that *venv* is mentioned in the current interpreter selection:  

![](resources/env-created.jpg)  

![](resources/selected-interpreter-venv.jpg)

### Render Quarto document

> Open `test-page.qmd`:  

::: {.column-margin}
**Testing:**    

1. Positron  
1. Python  
1. Python packages  
1. Quarto  
:::

![](resources/qmd-open.jpg)  

> From the Command Palette select *Quarto: Render Document*:  

![](resources/qmd-render.jpg)

> Select *Render HTML*:  

![](resources/render-html.jpg)

> The terminal pane will detail progress:  

![](resources/terminal-output.jpg)

> The Positron default is for the HTML output to be shown in a preview pane. Alternatively, you can check the output by opening the `test_page.html` in your browser.
