## Introduction 

The purpose of this repo is to help with testing of development environments e.g. using Python for data analysis.  

## Notes on testing

Notes on testing: [scc-pi.github.io/test-dev-env](https://scc-pi.github.io/test-dev-env)

The notes are rendered to HTML using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/), specifically the `dev_env_testing.qmd` file.    

The notes are served via [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages). They are rendered locally rather than via [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/get-started/understand-github-actions) i.e. after any changes to the `.qmd` file you need to render the HTML before making a pull request. 

## Updating the repo

Don't make changes directly to `main`. Make changes by creating a new branch and submitting a pull request.    

## Updating the readme

The `readme.md` file is generated via `readme.qmd`.
